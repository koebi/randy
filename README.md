Pathfinder Random Item Generator

Purpose
-------

Random item generation in Pathfinder is fun, as long as it's one item at a time. It's a pain in the ass, as soon as you've got to generate more than two items at the same time. As all other item generators seem to be quite crappy (my GMs words), this is my approach.
